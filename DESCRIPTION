Description: An ecosystem and grammar, based on the tidyverse, for conducting
    regression analysis and easily developing regression methods, statistics, 
    and tests. The framework is designed to assist users by offering enhanced 
    model selection tools using non-standard evaluation, allowing multiple 
    regression models to be easily estimated and compared, and a simple method 
    for changing standard errors, including statistics, and performing tests.
